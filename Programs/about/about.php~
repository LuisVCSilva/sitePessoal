I'm currently working as a Front-End Developer at Jotform (I was hired through Upwork) and I'm interested in getting a Master's Degree in the future, something related to Computational Physics or Mathematical Modelling.
My areas of interest are very broad, I really like artificial inteligence (optimization techniques), image processing, augmented/virtual reality, computational physics and computer science in general.",

        "A little bit about this website:" => "This website is basically a 'terminal-like' application in which all commands inputed are sent to a PHP server through AJAX, every command that you call is actually a PHP script that runs in the server and return it's output as a JSON to the page, if the command you typed is not associated with any PHP script in the server, the command is interpreted as a Javascript statement, running on your side. Every PHP script will return a JSON, if this JSON has a key named 'eval', the code will be automatically executed in your browser. I made my personal website like this because it's easier to use (no buttons or menus, you just type what you want), and I can easily program more stuff here and care only to the 'logic' stuff, no interface design (I could do it if I wanted it, I just don't)."
