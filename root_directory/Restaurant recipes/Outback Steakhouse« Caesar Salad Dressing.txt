Outback Steakhouse® Caesar Salad Dressing 

Ask and you shall receive. To answer many requests,
 I've whipped up this killer clone for the mouth-watering
 caesar salad dressing from America's favorite steakhouse 
chain. You can't buy it in the stores, but now you can make
 it from scratch in mere minutes. Best of all, this dressing
 keeps for weeks and weeks in the fridge in a covered container
 (if it's even around that long).

1 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup egg substitute
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon anchovy paste
2 cloves garlic, pressed
2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon coarse ground pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley flakes, crushed fine

1. Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl. Use an electric
 mixer to beat ingredients for about 1 minute.
2. Cover bowl and chill for several hours so that flavors can
 develop.
Makes approximately 2 cups.
