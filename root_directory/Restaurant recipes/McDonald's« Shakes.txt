McDonald's® Shakes

All right, it's the middle of summer and it's dang hot out.
 Wouldn't it be nice if we could whip up a little something
 to help keep those beads of sweat from rollin'? Check out 
how simple it is to recreate any of the three flavors of 
McDonald's thick shakes from scratch. Just three ingredients
 to each clone. And the secret ingredient for the chocolate 
and strawberry flavors is Nesquik mix. How McEasy is that? 
Throw everything in a blender and press a button -- the one 
on the right. And if you want your shake thicker, just put 
it in the freezer for a while. That's it! 

Vanilla Shake
2 cups vanilla ice cream
1 1/4 cups low fat milk
