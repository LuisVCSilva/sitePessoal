KFC® Potato Salad

Here's a simple clone for the potato salad that is purchased
 as a side dish from America's largest fast food chicken chain.
 Some of the skin is left on the potatoes in the real thing, so
 you don't have to peel them too thoroughly.  Just be sure to 
chop your potatoes into cubes that are approximately 1/2-inch thick,
 and then let the salad marinate for at least 4 hours so that the
 flavors can properly develop. If you let the salad chill overnight,
 it tastes even better. 

2 pounds russet potatoes
1 cup mayonnaise
4 teaspoons sweet pickle relish
4 teaspoons sugar
2 teaspoons minced white onion
2 teaspoons prepared mustard
1 teaspoon vinegar
1 teaspoon minced celery
1 teaspoon diced pimentos
1/2 teaspoon shredded carrot
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon pepper
dash salt

1. Lightly peel the potatoes (you don't have to get all of the
 skin off) then chop them into bite-size pieces and boil in 6 cups
 of boiling, salted water for 7 to10 minutes. The potato chuncks
 should be tender, yet slightly tough in the middle when done. 
Drain and rinse potatoes with cold water.
2. In a medium bowl, combine remaining ingredients and whisk until
 smooth.
3. Poured drained potatoes into a large bowl. Pour the dressing
 over the potatoes and mix until well combined.
4. Cover and chill for at least 4 hours. Overnight is best.
Makes 6 cups (about 8 servings).
