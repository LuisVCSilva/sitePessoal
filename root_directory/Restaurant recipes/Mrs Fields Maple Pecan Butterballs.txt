      Preheat oven to 300d F.  In a medium bowl combine flour, soda, cinnamon
  and finely ground pecans.  For extra flavor, saute pecans in 1 Tbl butter
  until slightly browned. Mix ingredients well with a wire whisk and set
  aside.  In a medium bowl cream butter and sugar with an electric mixer
  until mixture forms a grainy paste. Add syrup and egg and beat until
  slightly thickened.  Add the flour mixture and blend at low speed just
  until combined. Place dough in plastic bag and refrigerate until firm,
  about 1 hour. Remove dough from refrigerator and shape into 1-inch balls.
  Place cookies on ungreased cookie sheets 1 inch apart. Bake 17-18 minutes
  or until cookie bottoms are golden brown. Immediately transfer to a cool,
  flat surface.
