   1      tablespoon    Molasses
   3                    Raw egg whites
   1      cup           Dark raisins
   1 1/2  teaspoons     Vanilla
   1      cup           Light brown sugar -- packed
   1      cup           Granulated sugar
     1/2  cup           Non-fat dry milk powder
     1/2  teaspoon      Cinnamon
   1 1/2  teaspoons     Baking powder
   2 1/2  cups          Quaker brand quick-cooking -- rolled oats
   1      cup           All-purpose flour

Put molasses, egg whites and raisins into blender and blend on high speed
just to mince but not to puree (about 5-10 seconds). Empty mixture into
medium mixing bowl. With mixer beat in on medium speed each of the
remaining ingredients, beating well after each addition, adding both the
oats and flour in small portions. Switch to mixing spoon if dough becomes
too stiff for mixer. Lightly spray cookie sheet with Pam and wipe off
excess lightly with paper towel; any excess of the cookie sheet may burn
while cookies are baking. You need only a very light film of the Pam just
to keep cookies from sticking. Use 1 measuring teaspoonful of dough for
each cookie and place 2" apart on prepared cookie sheet. Bake in preheated
350~ oven 6-8 minutes. Do not overbake. Cool on paper towels, removing
from cookie sheets carefully.
