GrandMa's® Peanut Butter Big Cookies

When these cookies are cool, be sure to seal them up 
real super duper tight in something like Tupperware or
 a Ziploc bag. That's the way to keep these puppies moist
 and chewy like the original GrandMa's Big Cookies. In fact,
 the real product claims to be the only national cookie brand
 that guarantees the freshness of the product or double your 
money back. That's very big of the current manufacturer, 
Frito-Lay, which purchased the GrandMa's Cookies brand from
 General Mills back in 1980. 

1/2 cup vegetable shortening 
1/2 cup Peter Pan peanut butter
1 1/4 cups packed dark brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
2 teaspoons baking soda

1. Preheat oven to 275 degrees.
2. Beat shortening, peanut butter, brown sugar, egg, vanilla,
 and salt together in large bowl until smooth.
3. In a separate bowl combine the flour and baking soda. Slowly
 add the dry mixture to the wet mixture while beating. 
4. Roll 3 tablespoon-size portions of the dough into a ball in
 your hands and press to 1/2-inch flat on an ungreased baking 
sheet. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes. Be careful not to overcook, 
or the cookies will not be chewy and you may negatively impact
 the full enjoyment potential of the product.
Makes 14 to 16 cookies.
