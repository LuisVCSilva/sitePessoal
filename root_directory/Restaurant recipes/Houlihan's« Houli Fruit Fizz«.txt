Houlihan's® Houli Fruit Fizz®

Restaurateurs Joseph Gilbert and John Robinson needed a name
 for the new restaurant they planned to open in the Country 
Club Plaza of Kansas City, Missouri. To make the job easy, 
they kept the name of the location's previous tenant -- a
 clothing store called Houlihan's Men's Wear -- and opened
 Houlihan's Old Place in 1972. This was at the time when 
T.G.I. Friday's was popularizing casual dining, so the concept
 was an instant hit. That early success led to more Houlihan's
 opening in other states, and another multi-million dollar chain
 was born. The Houli Fruit Fizz is a simple blend of fruit juices
 and Sprite that can be served with a meal or enjoyed on its own.
 This drink is one of Houlihan's own classic, signature recipes. 

1 12-ounce can cold Sprite
1/2 cup cold pineapple juice
1/4 cup cold orange juice
1 cup cold cranberry juice

1. Combine all of the ingredients in a pitcher and pour into two
 glasses over ice. Be sure all of the ingredients are cold when
 combined.
