Taco Bell® Taco Seasoning Mix 

This is a simple recipe to clone the contents of the
 seasoning packet that bears the Taco Bell logo found
 in practically all the grocery stores these days. You
 probably expect the seasoning mix to make meat that 
tastes exactly like the stuff you get at the big chain.
 Well, uh, nope. It's more like the popular Lawry's seasoning
 mix, which still makes good spiced ground meat, and works 
great for a tasty bunch of tacos. But if it's the mushy,
 spiced meat that’s packed into tacos and burritos at America's
 largest taco joint that you want, you'll have to use the clone
 recipe for the Taco Bell Taco. 

2 tablespoons flour
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons dried minced onion
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon paprika
3/4 teaspoon crushed beef bouillon cube
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
dash onion powder

1. Combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl.
2. Prepare taco meat using 1 pound of ground beef and following
 the same spunky directions as on the original package:

1. BROWN ground beef; drain. Add seasoning mix and 3/4 cup of
 water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Simmer uncovered, 10 minutes,
 stirring occasionally.
2. HEAT taco shells or tortillas as directed on package.
3. SERVE bowls of seasoned ground beef, lettuce, tomato and
 cheese. Pass the taco shells or tortillas and let everyone 
PILE ON THE FUN!
Makes 12 tacos.
