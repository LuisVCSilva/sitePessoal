Red Lobster® Cheddar Bay Crab Bake®

Ahoy. Here's a cool clone for a pizza-shaped adaptation
 of Red Lobster's famous Cheddar Bay Biscuits, with a 
little crab thrown in. If you like those tender, cheesy
 biscuits that come with every meal at Red Lobster, then
 you'll surely like this new recipe. Plus, it's a cinch
 to make. I suggest you use fresh crabmeat as they do in
 the restaurants, but if it's only the canned stuff you 
have available, no problem. You'll still be able to enjoy
 the taste of Red Lobster's appetizer, without having to
leave a tip. 

2 cups Bisquick baking mix
1 3/4 cup finely shredded cheddar cheese
2/3 cups milk
2 tablespoons butter, melted and divided
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon fine parsley flakes
1/3 cup crab meat (fresh or canned lump)

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
2. Combine baking mix, 1 cup of the cheddar cheese, milk, 
and 1 half of the melted butter in a medium bowl. Mix by 
hand until well-combined.
3. Pat out the dough into circle approximately 8 inches in 
diameter, with a slight lip around the edge, like a pizza crust.
4. Sprinkle the parsley over the top of the dough. Be sure
 the dried parsley flakes are crushed fine. You can easily 
crush the flakes in a small bowl with your thumb and forefinger.
5. Sprinkle the crab over the top of the dough.
6. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the crab. Don’t go all
 of the way to the edge of the dough – leave a margin of a 
half-inch or so around the edge. 
7. Bake for 14-16 minutes or until the cheese on top begins 
to slightly brown. 
8. Combine the remaining butter with the garlic powder and 
brush it over the top of the bake as soon as it comes out of
 the oven. Slice it like a pizza into 8 pieces and serve hot.
