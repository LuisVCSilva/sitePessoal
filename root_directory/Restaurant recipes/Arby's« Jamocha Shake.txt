Arby's® Jamocha Shake

Okay, wash out the blender; this one's been
 begging to be cloned for years now. Arby's 
famous Jamocha Shake was one of the first frozen
 coffee drinks to gain popularity, even before 
Starbucks pummeled us with Frappuccinos. This 
thick drink is actually more milk shake than 
coffee drink, but if you like the original,
 you'll love this easy-to-make clone that serves two.  

1 cup cold coffee
1 cup low-fat milk
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
3 cups vanilla ice cream
3 tablespoons chocolate syrup

1. Combine the coffee, milk, and sugar in a blender and
 mix on medium speed for 15 seconds to dissolve the sugar.
2. Add ice cream, and chocolate syrup then blend on high 
speed until smooth and creamy. Stop blender and stir mixture
 with a spoon if necessary to help blend ingredients. 
3. Pour drink into two 16-ounce glasses.
Makes 2 large drinks.
