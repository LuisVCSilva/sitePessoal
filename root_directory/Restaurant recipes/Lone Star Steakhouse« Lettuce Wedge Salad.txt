Lone Star Steakhouse® Lettuce Wedge Salad

Why waste time chopping up the lettuce when you can just
 hack a head into four chunks, dress it up and serve? This
 unique presentation is not only easy to make, but also a 
deliciously different way to serve your next salad. The creamy
 bleu cheese dressing is a cinch to make from scratch and tastes
 much better than anything you'll buy in a store. Add a bit of
 extra crumbled bleu over the top, some freshly diced tomatoes,
 and you're well on your way to a fancy-pants side salad that'll
 surely impress.
