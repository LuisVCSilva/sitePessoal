Preparation Instructions: Mix yeast, brown sugar, dash of salt
 and 1 1/2 cups water. Let sit for five minutes. Add bread flour.
 Knead well. Let rise for about one hour. Grease baking sheet. 
Mix baking soda and warm water. Take a piece of dough and roll
 and shape into a pretzel. The easiest way to shape is to roll
 into a rope, whatever size you prefer. Pinch ends of rope then
 bring ends of rope to other side of circle. Dip pretzels in
 warm water and baking soda mixture and put on baking sheet.

with melted butter and honey. Sprinkle with white and brown 
sugar (approx. half and half mixture).
