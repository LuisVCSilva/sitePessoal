Taco Bell Soft Taco 

If you don't think those packets of Taco Bell spices you
 buy in the grocery stores makes spiced ground meat that
 tastes like the stuff they use at the giant Mexican food
 chain, you'd be correct. If you want the taco meat to taste
 right you're going to have to whip it up from scratch using
 this original TSR recipe. Once you've prepped your meat,
 these steps will help you build your tacos the Taco Bell 
way, without any pesky talking Chihuahuas running through 
the kitchen.

1 pound lean ground beef
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried minced onion
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
dash garlic powder
1/2 cup water
12 soft taco flour tortillas (6-inch tortillas)
2 cups shredded lettuce
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

1. In a medium bowl, combine the ground beef with the flour,
 chili powder, salt, minced onion, paprika, onion powder, and
 garlic powder. Use your hands to thoroughly mix the ingredients
 into the ground beef.
2. Add the seasoned beef mixture to the water in a skillet over
 medium heat. Mix well with a wooden spoon or spatula, and break
 up the meat as it cooks. Heat for 5 to 6 minutes, or until browned.
 The finished product should be very smooth, somewhat pasty, with no
 large chunks of beef remaining.
3. Heat up the flour tortillas in your microwave for 20 - 30 seconds,
 or until warm.
4. Build each taco by spooning 2 to 3 tablespoons of the meat into
 a warm tortilla. Spread some of the shredded lettuce over the meat
 and then sprinkle some cheese over the top. Repeat with the
 remaining ingredients and serve immediately.
Makes 12 soft tacos.
