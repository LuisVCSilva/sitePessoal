Kraft® Deluxe Original Macaroni & Cheese Dinner

It's time to clone America's best-selling brand of instant 
macaroni & cheese.  This recipe is for the "Deluxe" variety
 of this popular product - that is, the one that comes with 
an envelope of thick cheese sauce, rather than the dry, 
powdered cheese.  I think the "Deluxe" version, with it's
 two-cheese blend, is the better tasting of the two, although
 it's gonna hit you a bit harder in the wallet at the supermarket.
  But now, with this Top Secret Recipe, you can make creamy 
macaroni & cheese that taste like Kraft's original at a fraction
 of the price of the real deal. You gotta love that!

8 cups water
2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni
1/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 cup Cheez Whiz
2 tablespoons whole milk
1/4 teaspoon salt

1. Bring 8 cups (2 quarts) of water to a boil over high heat in
 a large saucepan. Add elbow macaroni to water and cook for
 10 to 12 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally.
2. As macaroni boils, prepare sauce by combining cheddar cheese,
 Cheez Whiz, and milk in a small saucepan over medium low heat.
 Stir cheese mixture often as it heats, so that it does not burn.
 Add salt. When all of the cheddar cheese has melted and the sauce
 is smooth, cover pan and set aside until macaroni is ready.
3. When macaroni is ready, strain water, but do not rinse the
 macaroni.
4. Using the same pan you prepared the macaroni in, combine the
 macaroni with the cheese sauce, and mix well. 
Makes about 4 cups.
