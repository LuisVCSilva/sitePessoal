Pepperidge Farm® Ginger Man Cookies®

When cloning cookies for the holidays, why not clone the best?
 Pepperidge Farm's Ginger Man cookies bring a sweet gingery crunch
 to the seasonal festivities. And so will your version no matter 
what shape they end up. 

1 cup packed dark brown sugar
3/4 cup granulated sugar 
1/2 cup shortening 
1/4 cup molasses 
2 eggs 
1/2 teaspoon vanilla 
2 cups all-purpose flour 
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder 
1 teaspoon ground ginger 
1 teaspoon salt 
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
red sugar crystals (for cake decorating) 
Cut your cookies into any crazy shape you want (these are mentally 
deranged snowmen), then sprinkle on the red sugar crystals. 
 

1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. 
2. Cream together the sugars, shortening, molasses, eggs, and vanilla
 in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth.
3. In another large bowl, combine flour, baking soda, baking powder,
 ginger, salt, cinnamon, and cloves.
4. Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, stirring while you add it.
5. Roll a portion of the dough out on a heavily floured surface. Roll
 to under 1/4-inch thick. Cut the cookies using a man-shaped cookie
 cutter, or any other cookie cutter shape you've got in the bottom
 drawer.
6. Place cookies on an oiled cookie sheet and bake for 15 to 18
 minutes. Bake only one cookie sheet of cookies at a time. 
Makes around 3 dozen cookies.
