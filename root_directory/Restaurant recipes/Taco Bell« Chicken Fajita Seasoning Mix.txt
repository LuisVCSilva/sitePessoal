Taco Bell® Chicken Fajita Seasoning Mix 

A couple years ago Taco Bell and Kraft Foods got together
 to produce a line of products - everything from taco kits
 to salsas and spice mixes - all stamped with the familiar
 Taco Bell logo and available in supermarkets across the country.
 The idea was a winner, and now the Taco Bell line of products 
is among Kraft's top sellers.  The clone of this mix, made with 
a combination of common spices and cornstarch, can be kept
 indefinitely until your brain's fajita-craving neurons begin 
firing. When you're set to cook, you'll just need some chicken,
 a bell pepper, and an onion, and then you simply follow the 
same instructions that you find on the package of the real thing. 

1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon crushed chicken bouillon cube
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon cumin

1. Combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl.
2. Prepare fajitas using the following ingredients:


4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (1 to 1 1/4 lb.), cut into 
thin strips
2 tablespoons oil
1/3 cup water
1 green bell pepper, cut into strips
1 medium onion, sliced 

Prepare the fajitas using the same directions found on the package
 of the original seasoning mix:

1. COOK and stir chicken in hot oil in a large nonstick skillet 5
 minutes on medium-high heat. Add TACO BELL Fajita Seasoning Mix,
 water, green pepper, and onion; cook and stir on medium heat 5 
minutes or until chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are
 tender.
2. PLACE tortillas on microwavable plate. Cover with plastic wrap.
 Microwave on high 1 minute.
3. SPOON chicken mixture onto each tortilla. Top as desired with 
TACO BELL salsa. Roll up tortillas. 

Makes 5 servings.
