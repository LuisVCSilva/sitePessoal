Red Lobster® Tartar Sauce 

Here's a clone for that dollop of sweet, creamy goodness that
comes alongside your fish entree at the world's largest seafood
chain. I've received many e-mail requests for this one, and
there have been several versions posted on the TSR Message
Board. I think you'll find this never-before-revealed clone
recipe gives you a quick and tasty sauce that has the look
and flavor of the real thing. Use the sauce to dress up your
next home-cooked fish platter or as a spread on a variety of 
sandwiches. 

1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 1/2 tablespoons finely minced onion
1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish
1 1/2 teaspoons shredded & chopped carrot (bits the size of rice)
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar

1. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.
2. Cover and chill. 
Makes 4 servings.
