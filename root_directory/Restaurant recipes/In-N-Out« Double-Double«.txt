In-N-Out® Double-Double®

This is a recipe for making what I believe is the best
 hamburger in the world. The secret to duplicating this
 and other fast-food burgers is getting the beef patties
 real thin...about 1/4 inch-thick. If you like, you can 
press the beef thin onto wax paper and freeze the patties
 ahead of time. This makes them easier to work with on the
 hot pan.

1 plain hamburger bun
1/3 pound ground beef
Dash salt
1 tablespoon Kraft Thousand Island dressing
1 large tomato slice (or 2 small slices)
1 large lettuce leaf
4 slices American cheese (Singles)
-or- 2 slices real American cheese
1 whole onion slice (sliced thin)

1. Preheat a frying pan over medium heat.
2. Lightly toast the both halves of the hamburger bun,
 face down in the pan. Set aside.
3. Separate the beef into two even portions, and form each
 half into a thin patty slightly larger than the bun.
4. Lightly salt each patty and cook for 2-3 minutes on the
 first side.
5. Flip the patties over and immediately place two slices of
 cheese on each one. Cook for 2-3 minutes.
6. Assemble the burger in the following stacking order from 
the bottom up:
bottom bun
dressing
tomato
lettuce
beef patty with cheese
onion slice
beef patty with cheese
top bun.

Makes one hamburger.
