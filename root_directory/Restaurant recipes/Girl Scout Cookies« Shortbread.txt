Girl Scout Cookies® Shortbread 

Since they only sell these once a year, right around 
springtime, you're bound to get a craving sometime around fall.
  And if you're still holding onto a box, they may have begun
to taste a bit like used air-hockey pucks. Now you can toss out
 those relics and fill the box with a fresh batch, made from 
this clone recipe for the first variety of cookies sold by the
 Girl Scouts back in 1917.

1/2 cup butter-flavored shortening
1 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons beaten egg
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoons buttermilk
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (plus an extra 1/4 cup reserved for
 rolling)
1/8 teaspoon baking powder

1. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the shortening, sugar,
 vanilla, and salt with an electric mixer.
2. Add the egg and beat mixture until it's fluffy. Add the baking
 soda and mix for about 20 seconds, then add the buttermilk and mix
 for an additional 30 seconds.
3. In another bowl, combine the flour and baking powder.
4. Pour dry ingredients into wet ingredients and mix well with an
 electric mixer until flour is incorporated.
5. Roll the dough into a ball, cover it with plastic wrap, and chill
 it for 1 hour.
6. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
7. Roll dough out on a well-floured surface to 1/8-inch thick and 
punch out cookies with a 1 1/2 to 2-inch cutter (a medium-size spice
 bottle lid works well). Arrange cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet.
8. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.
Makes 60 cookies.
