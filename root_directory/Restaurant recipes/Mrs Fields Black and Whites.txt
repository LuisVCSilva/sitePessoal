      Yield: 36 servings
 
  2 1/4 c  All purpose flour
    1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Dark brown sugar; packed
    3/4 c  White sugar
      1 c  Salted butter; soft
      3 lg Eggs
      2 ts Pure vanilla extract
  5 1/4 oz Semisweet chocolate bar
           - coarsely chop
  5 1/4 oz White chocolate bar;
           -coarsely chop
 
    Preheat oven to 300 degrees (yes, it says 300)   In a medium bowl combine
  flour, cocoa, soda and salt. Mix well with a wire whisk. Set aside. Blend
  sugars in a large bowl using an electric mixer set at medium speed. Add
  butter and mix to form a grainy paste, scraping down the sides of the bowl.
  Add eggs and vanilla, and beat at medium speed until smooth. Add the flour
  mixture and chocolates, and blend at low speed until just combined. Do not
  overmix.    Drop by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased cookie sheets, 2
  inches apart. Bake 23-25 minutes. Transfer cookies immediately to a cool
  flat surface. Yield: 3 dozen.
   *NOTE: I just made her oatmeal cookies, also 300 degrees for 23-25 minutes
  and found I had to leave them in the oven a little longer.
