Outback Steakhouse® Bleu Cheese Dressing 

     If you've had the Kookaburra Wings from Outback, then
 you've tasted the chain's thick and creamy bleu cheese dressing
 served up on the side. Use this stuff when you need an excellent
 dipping sauce for your next batch of wings, or just pour it over
 a salad and dive in.

1/8 teaspoon onion powder 
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder   

1. Mix all ingredients together by hand in a small bowl until smooth.
2. Cover and chill for 30 minutes before serving. 
Makes 1 cup.
