Nabisco® Nilla® Wafers

No one knows the exact origin of the vanilla wafer but it's
 guessed that the recipe was developed in the south.  The wafers
 were being whipped up from scratch at home long before Nabisco
 introduced the lightweight, poker chip-like packaged cookies in
 1945.  Back then they were called Vanilla Wafers.  But in the 60s
 Nabisco slapped the trade name Nilla Wafers on the box.  Today the
 real things come about 100 to a box and really fly when whipped 
into the air with a little flick of the wrist.  Here now, you can
 relive the days of old with a homemade version fresh out of the oven.
  This clone recipe makes about half a box's worth and they fly just
 as far.

aerodynamics - check out the clone for Sunshine Lemon Coolers.
