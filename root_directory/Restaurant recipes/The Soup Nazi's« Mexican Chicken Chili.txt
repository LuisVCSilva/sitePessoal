The Soup Nazi's® Mexican Chicken Chili 

1 pound chicken breast fillets (4 fillets)
1 tablespoon olive oil
10 cups water
2 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup tomato sauce
1 potato, peeled & chopped
1 small onion, diced
1 cup frozen yellow corn
1/2 carrot, sliced
1 celery stalk, diced
1 cup canned diced tomatoes
1 15-ounce can red kidney beans, plus liquid
1/4 cup diced canned pimento
1 jalapeno, diced
1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder 
1 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt
dash cayenne pepper
dash basil
dash oregano

On the side
Sour cream
Pinch chopped Italian parsley

1. Sauté the chicken breasts in the olive oil in a large pot
 over medium/high heat. Cook the chicken on both side until
 done -- about 7-10 minutes per side. Cool the chicken until 
it can be handled. Do not rinse the pot.
2. Shred the chicken by hand into bite-sizes pieces and place
 the pieces back into the pot.
3. Add the remaining ingredients to the pot and turn heat to 
high. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for
 4-5 hours. Stir mixture often so that many of the chicken pieces
 shred into much smaller bits. Chili should reduce substantially
 to thicken and darken (less orange, more brown) when done.
4. Combine some chopped Italian parsley with sour cream and serve
 it on the side for topping the chili, if desired.  
Makes 4-6 servings.
