Lone Star Steakhouse® Chili

When the weather gets cold it's time to fire up the stovetop.
 This chain makes a tasty chili that warms the bones on a nippy
 fall day. This clone recipe is easy-to-make, low-fat and 
delicious. And if it's super brisk outside, you might want to add
 an additional tablespoon of diced jalapeno to aggressively stoke
 those internal flames.

1 diced onion 
1 tablespoon diced fresh jalapeno pepper 
1 15-ounce can kidney beans with liquid
1 14.5-ounce can peeled diced tomatoes

1 cup water
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
