Benihana Japanese Fried Rice

4 cups cooked rice 
1 cup frozen peas - thawed 
2 tbsp finely grated carrot 
2 eggs - beaten 
½ cup diced onion 
 1½ tbsp butter 
2 tbsp soy sauce 
salt 
pepper 

Cook rice following instructions on package (Bring 2 cups
 water to a boil, add rice and a dash of salt, reduce heat
 and simmer in covered saucepan for 20 minutes). Pour rice
 into a large bowl to let it cool in the refrigerator. Scramble
 the eggs in a small pan over medium heat. Separate the scrambled
 chunks of egg into small pea-size bits while cooking. When rice
 has cooled to near room temperature, add peas, grated carrot,
 scrambled egg and diced onion to the bowl. Carefully toss all
 of the ingredients together. Melt 1½ tbsp of butter in a large
 frying pan over medium/high heat. When butter has completely
 melted, dump the bowl of rice and other ingredients into the
 pan and add soy sauce plus a dash of salt and pepper. Cook
 rice for 6-8 minutes over heat, stirring often. 

Makes 4 servings.
