McDonald's® Biscuits

Them's the biscuits served at America's most popular stop
for breakfast, partners - simple to make and gosh darn tasty.
 Get yourself some Bisquick and buttermilk and crank up the 
oven for a clone that's become one very frequent request. 

2 cups Bisquick baking mix
2/3 cups buttermilk
2 teaspoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons margarine, melted and divided

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
2. Combine the baking mix, buttermilk, sugar, salt, and half of
 the melted margarine in a medium bowl. Mix until well blended.
3. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 30 
seconds, or until dough becomes elastic.
4. Roll dough to about 3/4-inch thick and punch out biscuits using
 a 3-inch cutter. Arrange the punched-out dough on an ungreased 
baking sheet, and bake for 10 to12 minutes or until the biscuits 
are golden on top and have doubled in height.
5. Remove the biscuits from the oven and immediately brush each one
 with a light coating of the remaining melted margarine. Serve warm.
Makes 8 biscuits.
