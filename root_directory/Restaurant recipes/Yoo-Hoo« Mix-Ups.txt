Yoo-Hoo® Mix-Ups

A while back when I was rummaging through my pantry
 I came upon several bottles of flavored Yoo-hoo that
 I had scored from Wal-Mart and tucked away for over a year.
 Each of the bottles was covered with a little dust and needed
 a pretty fierce shaking, but the contents were very well
 preserved and quite tasty. After some Web browsing of a few
 unofficial Yoo-hoo Web sites, I discovered these worshipped 
"Mix-ups" variety of the famous chocolate drink had since been
 put to rest. Now, after a little work in the top secret
 "lab," I've come up with a way to clone the flavor of these
 bottled products which can no longer be obtained outside of
 the ethereal food-world afterlife.

Chocolate-Banana
3/4 cup nonfat dry milk
3 tablespoons Nesquik chocolate drink powder
1 1/2 cups cold water
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon banana extract

Chocolate-Strawberry
3/4 cup nonfat dry milk
3 tablespoons Nesquik chocolate drink powder
3 cups cold water
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons strawberry extract

Chocolate-Mint
3/4 cup nonfat dry milk
3 tablespoons Nesquik chocolate drink powder
1 1/2 cups cold water
1 teaspoonn sugar
dash mint extract (less than 1/8 teaspoon)

Combine all the ingredients in a blender for the flavor of your
 choice in a container or jar with a lid. Shake until dry milk 
is dissolved. Drink immediately or chill in the refrigerator.
Makes 1 14-ounce drink.
