KFC® Cole Slaw

If you've ever seen a clone recipe for KFC Cole Slaw floating
 around on the Internet, it probably looks like this. That's 
because this formula has become one of the most copied & pasted
 recipes from the first book, "Top Secret Recipes." It's also 
one of the most requested recipes on the TSR Message Board. So,
 to fulfill all those requests, and to stake claim to a recipe 
that's rarely sourced as a TSR original, here's the killer recipe
 to clone the world's best slaw. And, because I love to out-clone
 the "copycats", I'm going to take it one step further. Tune in 
next week for an original version of this clone recipe that tastes
 just like the real thing but includes only five ingredients...and
 is completely fat free! Don't believe it? Be here next Monday.

8 cups finely chopped cabbage (about 1 head)
1/4 cup shredded carrot (1 medium carrot)
2 tablespoons minced onion
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 tablespoons white vinegar
2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice

1. Be sure cabbage and carrots are chopped up into very fine pieces
 (about the size of rice).
2. Combine the sugar, salt, pepper, milk, mayonnaise, buttermilk,
 vinegar, and lemon juice in a large bowl and beat until smooth.
3. Add the cabbage, carrots, and onion, and mix well.
4. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
