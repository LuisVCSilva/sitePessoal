McDonald's® Lobster Sandwich

Yes, this actually exists. On an excursion through some New
 England states I practically drove off the road when I first
 saw a sign advertising lobster at this fast food chain. I just
 had to get a closer look. That's when I discovered that this
 unique sandwich is served only at select McDonald's locations,
 mostly in Maine, for a limited time only during the summer months.
 It's basically a lobster salad served on a hoagie roll with some
 lettuce, but with fresh Maine lobster, is quite tasty.
Since you can't get this anywhere else, I figured this sandwich
 was a prime candidate for kitchen cloning. Here's a recipe to 
make a version of your own that has never before been published. 

1\2 cup cooked Maine Lobster (fresh is best)
1\2 tablespoon mayonnaise
pinch salt
1 lettuce leaf
small hoagie roll 

1. Mix together lobster, mayonnaise and salt.
2. Slice hoagie roll length wise, and spread the lettuce leaf on
 the bottom half. 
3. Spread lobster over lettuce. Top off sandwich with top half of
 the roll.
Makes 1 sandwich.
