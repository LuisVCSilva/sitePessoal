Swiss Miss® Fat-Free Tapioca Pudding

When the first instant hot cocoa mix was developed in the fifties,
 it was available only to the airlines in individual portions for
 passengers and was called Brown Swiss. This mix was so popular 
that the company packaged it for sale in the grocery stores and 
changed the name to Swiss Miss. In the seventies, the first Swiss
 Miss Puddings were introduced and quickly became the leader of 
dairy case puddings. When the fat-free versions of the puddings 
were introduced some 23 years later, they, too, would become a 
popular favorite.
No sugar needs to be added to this recipe that recreates one of
 the best-tasting brands of fat-free pudding on the market. The 
condensed milk is enough to sweeten the pudding; plus it provides
 a creamy consistency, which, along with the cornstarch, helps 
replace fat found in the full-fat version of this tasty tapioca treat. 
It's a simple recipe to make and you won't even "miss" the fat.

2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 1/2 cups fat-free milk
1/2 cup sweetened condensed skim milk
dash salt
2 1/2 tablespoons instant tapioca
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

1. Combine the cornstarch with the fat-free milk in a medium saucepan
 and whisk thoroughly to dissolve the cornstarch.
2. Add the condensed milk, salt, and tapioca to the pan. Stir until
 smooth and then set the pan aside for 5 minutes.
3. After 5 minutes, bring the mixture to a boil over medium/low heat,
 stirring constantly until it thickens, then cover and remove from the
 heat.  Let the pudding sit, covered, for 20 minutes.
4. Stir in the vanilla, then transfer the pudding to serving cups.
  Cover the cups with plastic wrap and let them chill for at least 
2 to 3 hours before serving.
