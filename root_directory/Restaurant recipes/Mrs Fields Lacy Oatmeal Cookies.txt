  Recipe by: Mrs. Fields Cookie Book
       Preheat oven to 325 degrees; cover baking sheets with foil, then coat
  with nonstick cooking spray.  In a medium bowl, combine the oats, flour,
  salt and baking powder; mix well with a wire whisk and set aside. In a
  large bowl, combine the sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium
  speed to form a grainy paste.  Add the egg and vanilla extract; beat until
  smooth.  Add the flour mixture and blend just until combined.
       Drop the dough by teaspoonfuls 2 1/2 inches apart onto the cookie
  sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges begin to turn golden
  brown.  Let cool, then peel the cookies from the foil with your fingers. Be
  sure to respray the cookie sheets between batches.
