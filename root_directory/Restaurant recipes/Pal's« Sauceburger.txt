Pal's® Sauceburger

Here's a simple, great tasting burger from a small chain called
 Pal's in Tennessee. This little drive-thru developed this simple
 sauce -- a combination of ketchup, mustard and relish -- that 
makes quick production of scores of these tasty sandwiches a 
breeze when the line of cars grows long. Yes, it's easy...it's
 also very good on any burger at your next cookout.

1/8 pound ground beef
1 small sesame seed bun
salt
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 teaspoon sweet pickle relish
1/2 teaspoon yellow mustard


1. Pat out the ground beef until about the same diameter as the bun.
 If you like, you can freeze this patty ahead of time to help keep 
the burger from falling apart when you cook it.
2. Brown or toast the faces of the top and bottom buns. You can do 
this in a frying pan over medium heat or by toasting them in the
oven (or toaster oven).
3. As the buns are browning, grill the hamburger patty, either in
 a hot frying pan over medium heat...or you can use a barbecue grill.
 Salt the meat generously.
4. Combine the ketchup, relish and mustard in a small bowl.
5. When the meat is cooked to your liking, place it on the face of
 the bottom bun.
6. Slather the sauce on the face of the top bun and place it onto the

 meat. Ta-da...Sauceburger! 
Makes 1 burger.
