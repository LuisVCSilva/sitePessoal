Outback Steakhouse® Coral Reef 'Rita 

This Outback margarita selection will handily quench,
 soothe and ring the bell in your clock tower -- just what
 the doctor ordered for a hot summer evening fiesta. A mildly
 fruity on-the-rocks margarita is powerful ammunition in any 
home bartender's arsenal of party cocktails. I like tequila. 
Tequila is my friend. But get to the bottom of too many of 
these tasty pink drinks and you'll feel like a used pinata 
in the morning.

1 1/4 ounces Margaritaville gold tequila (1 shot)
3/4 ounce triple sec 
3 ounces (approx. 1/3 cup) cup sweet and sour mix 
3 ounces (approx. 1/3 cup) cranberry juice 
3/4 ounce Grand Marnier 
wedge of lime 
Optional
margarita salt (for rim of glass)
  

1. If you want salt on the rim of your glass, moisten the rim
 of a 16-ounce mug (or glass) and dip it in margarita salt. 
2. To make the drink, fill the glass with ice.
3. Add the tequila, triple sec, then some sweet and sour mix 
and cranberry juice (in equal amounts -- about 1/3 cup each 
should do it) to within a half-inch of the top of the glass. Stir.
4. Splash a half shot of Grand Marnier over the top of the drink. 
5. Add a wedge of lime and serve with a straw.
Makes 1 serving.
