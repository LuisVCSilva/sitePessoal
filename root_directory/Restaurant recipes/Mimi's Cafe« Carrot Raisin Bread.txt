Mimi's Cafe® Carrot Raisin Bread

It's dark, moist and delicious. And it comes in a bread basket
 to your table at this French-themed west coast casual restaurant.
 Now the tastiest carrot bread ever can be yours to create at home
 with a couple of grated carrots, molasses, raisins and chopped
 walnuts. You'll be baking this one in the oven for at least an
 hour. That should be enough time to warm up the house and send
 amazing smells wafting through every room. Line the carpet with
 newspaper to catch the family drool.
