      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Peanut butter; creamy
      3    Eggs
      1 c  Butter; softened
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Dark brown sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      2 c  Flour
 
     Preheat oven to 300 degrees. In a medium bowl, combine flour, soda, and
  salt.  Mix well with a wire whisk. In a large bowl, blend sugars using a
  mixer at medium speed. Add butter and mix to form a grainy paste. Add eggs,
  peanut butter, and vanilla.  Mix at medium speed until light and fluffy.
  Add the flour mixture and mix at low speed until just mixed. (Do not
  overmix). Drop by rounded tablespoons onto an ungreased cookie sheet, 1 1/2
  inches apart. With a wet fork, gently press a crisscross pattern on top of
  the cookies.
     Bake for 8-22 minutes until cookies are slightly brown along the edges.
  Transfer cookies immediately to cool surface with a spatula
