Wendy's® Chili 

Here's a favorite recipe for chili that clones the stuff served
 at the Wendy's chain. Dave Thomas, Wendy's founder, has been 
serving this chili since 1969, he year the first Wendy's opened
 its doors. Over the years the recipe has changed a bit, but 
this version here is an amazing copy of the version of chili 
served in the early 90's. Try topping it with some chopped onion
 and cheddar cheese, as you can request in the restaurant. 
2 pounds ground beef
One 29-ounce can tomato sauce
One 29-ounce can kidney beans (with liquid)
One 29-ounce can pinto beans (with liquid)
1 cup diced onion (1 medium onion)
1/2 cup diced green chili (2 chilies)
1/4 cup diced celery (1 stalk)
3 medium tomatoes, chopped
2 teaspoons cumin powder
3 tablespoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper
2 teaspoons salt
2 cups water 

1. Brown the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat; drain off
 the fat.
2. Using a fork, crumble the cooked beef into pea-size pieces.
3. In a large pot, combine the beef plus all the remaining ingredients,
 and bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook, stirring every 15 minutes,
 for 2 to 3 hours.

Makes about 12 servings. 

Tidbits

For spicier chili, add 1/2 teaspoon more black pepper.
For much spicier chili, add 1 teaspoon black pepper and a tablespoon
 cayenne pepper.
And for a real stomach stinger, add 5 or 6 sliced jalapeno peppers 
to the pot.
Leftovers can be frozen for several months.
