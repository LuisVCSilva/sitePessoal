Planet Hollywood® Signature Drinks

Here are clones for two of Planet Hollywood's most popular drinks.
 And, take it from me, they really hit the spot on a hot summer
 night. But, if you don't wanna feel like you were hit by a
 truck the next day, go easy on these babies -- they pack quite 
a punch. Serve 'em with a 7-dollar cheeseburger, crank up some
 clips of bad Stallone movies and it's almost like you're 
actually at a famous Hollywood-themed eatery.
