Lawry's® Seasoned Salt

This seven-ingredient clone of Lawry's Seasoned Salt can be
 made in a small bowl, but is best used when poured into an
 old spice bottle that you've cleaned out and saved. You've
 saved one of those somewhere, right?

1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cornstarch

1. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix well.
2. Pour blend into an empty spice bottle with shaker top to store.
Makes 1/4 cup.
