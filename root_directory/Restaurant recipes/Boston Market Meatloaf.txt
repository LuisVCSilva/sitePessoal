Boston Market Meatloaf

1 cup tomato sauce 
1½ tbsp Kraft barbecue sauce 
1 tbsp granulated sugar 
1½ lbs 10% fat ground sirloin 
6 tbsp all-purpose flour 
 ¾ tsp salt 
½ tsp onion powder 
¼ tsp ground black pepper 
dash garlic powder 
 
Preheat oven to 400°F. Combine the tomato sauce, barbecue
 sauce and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat the
 mixture until it begins to bubble, stirring often, then remove
 it from the heat. 

In a large bowl, add all but 2 tbsp of the tomato sauce to the meat.
 Use a large wooden spoon or your hands to work the sauce into the
 meat until it is very well combined. Combine the remaining 
ingredients with the ground sirloin-- flour, salt, onion powder
 and ground pepper. Use the wooden spoon or your hands to work 
the spices and flour into the meat. 

Load the meat into a loaf pan (preferably a meatloaf pan with two
 sections which allows the fat to drain, but if you don't have 
one of those a regular loaf pan will work). Wrap foil over the 
pan and place it into the oven for 30 minutes. 

After 30 minutes, take the meatloaf from the oven, remove the 
foil and, if you aren't using a meatloaf pan, drain the fat.
 Using a knife, slice the meatloaf all the way through into 8 
slices while it is still in the pan. This will help to cook the 
center of the meatloaf. Pour the remaining 2 tbsp of sauce over 
the top of the meatloaf, in a stream down the center. Don't spread
 the sauce. Place the meatloaf back into the oven, uncovered, for
 25-30 minutes or until it is done. 

Remove and allow it to cool for a few minutes before serving. 

Makes 4 servings.
