Kraft® Thousand Island Dressing

Here's a quick clone for one of the best-selling thousand
 island dressings around. Use this one on salads or on burgers
 (such as the In-N-Out Double-Double clone) as a homemade
 "special sauce." It's easy, it's tasty, it's cheap and it
 can be made low fat simply by using low-fat mayo. Dig it.

1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon white vinegar
2 teaspoons sugar
2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish
1 teaspoon finely minced white onion
1/8 teaspoon salt
dash of black pepper

1. Combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl. Stir well.
2. Place dressing in a covered container and refrigerate for 
several hours, stirring occasionally, so that the sugar dissolves
 and the flavors blend.
Makes about 3/4 cup.
