--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    Chicken -- cut pieces w/skin
                        BROILER BASTING SAUCE
     1/3  cup           Lemon juice
     1/3  cup           Lime juice
     1/3  cup           Canola or vegetable oil
   1      teaspoon      Ground turmeric
     1/2  teaspoon      Garlic salt
     1/4  teaspoon      Black pepper

Briefly simmer the cut-up chicken in a deep-sided skillet, keeping pieces
in single layer without crowding them, until the meat appears milky white
and the juices run clear, no longer pink. Allow to cool in the broth,
uncovered, while you prepare the basting sauce. Arrange the chicken pieces
skin-side up on broiler pan in single layer and baste with enough of
mixture to evenly coat skin side. Turn and baste other side. Turn again to
skin side up and broil 6" from the heat, brushing with additional sauce
every few minutes until skin is really crispy and golden brown,
approximately 5 to 8 minutes for large pieces. BASTING MIXTURE-Mix juices,
oil, turmeric, salt and pepper. This makes enough to baste nine pieces.
