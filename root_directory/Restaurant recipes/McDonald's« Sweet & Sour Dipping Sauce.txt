McDonald's® Sweet & Sour Dipping Sauce

This recipe clones one of those sauces you get with your
 order of McNuggets at the world's largest hamburger outlet. 
 Now, instead of shoving a fistful of the little green packs
 into your backpack, you can make up a batch of your own to 
use as a dip for store bought nuggets, chicken fingers, fried
 shrimp, and tempura.  Or you can even use this as a sauce 
for the traditional Chinese sweet and sour dish (with pineapple,
 bell pepper, onion, and sautéed chicken or pork.)  It's a 
simple recipe that requires a food processor or a blender, 
and the sauce will keep well for some time in the fridge.

1/4 cup peach preserves
1/4 cup apricot preserves
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
5 teaspoons white vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon yellow mustard
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons water

1. Combine all ingredients except the water in a food processor
 or a blender and puree until the mixture is smooth. 
2. Pour mixture into a small saucepan over medium heat. Add water,
 stir, and bring mixture to a boil. Allow it to boil for five 
minutes, stirring often. When the sauce has thickened, remove 
it from the heat and let it cool. Store sauce in a covered 
container in the refrigerator.
Makes about 3/4 cup.
