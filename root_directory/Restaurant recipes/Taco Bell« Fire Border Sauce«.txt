Taco Bell® Fire Border Sauce®

For years Taco Bell customers had only the "mild" and "hot"
 varieties of free taco sauce blister packs to choose from 
to add a bit of zing to their fistful of tacos. That is, until
 a recent addition to the hot sauce selection kicked the 
heat-o-meter up a few notches. While true hot sauce freaks 
might find this sauce still on the mild side when compared 
with the glut of habanero-based sauces on the market today, 
it's definitely a recipe that improves on the Mexican fast-food
 chain's original formulas if you're one of the many who get a 
rush from a good tastebud tingle.

1 6-ounce can tomato paste
3 cups water
3 tablespoons vinegar
3 tablespoons finely minced canned jalapeno slices
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon dried minced onion
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
dash garlic powder

1. Combine the tomato paste with the water in a medium saucepan 
and whisk until smooth.
2. Add the remaining ingredients and stir until combined.
3. Heat mixture over medium high heat until it begins to boil. 
Continue to cook for about 3 minutes, stirring often. Remove from
 heat.
4. When sauce has cooled, poured it into a sealed container and 
refrigerate.
Makes 3 cups.
