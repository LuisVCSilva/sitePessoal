  Recipe by: Ruth Burkhardt (KKBG35A)
        Combine flour and sugar in a medium bowl using an electric mixer set
  on medium speed.  Add butter and mix until the dough forms small, pea-sized
  pellets. Add chilled maple syrup and 2 Tbl water, and mix on low speed
  until dough can be formed into a ball, do not overmix or the dough will be
  tough!  Separate dough into 2 balls andflatten into disks. Wrap dough
  tightly in plastic wrap or place in plastice bags. Refrigerate for 2 hrs.
  To Prepare the Filling: Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.
        Preheat oven to 325d F. Using a floured rolling pin on a floured
  board, roll one piece of dough into a rough rectangle 10 inches wide, 15
  inches long, and 1/8 inch thick. Sprinkle dough with half of the
  cinnamon-sugar filling. Starting with smaller side, roll dough up tightly
  into a cylinder. Wrap each roll in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
        Using a sharp thin knife, cut 1/4 inch slices from each roll. Place
  slices on ungreased baking sheets, 1 inch apart. Brush tips lightly with
  1/4 cup maple syrup. Bake for 16-17 minutes or until light golden brown.
  Immediately transfer cookies to a cool, flat surface.
