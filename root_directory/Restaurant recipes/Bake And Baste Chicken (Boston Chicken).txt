  1/4 c  Canola oil
      1 tb Honey
      1 tb Lime juice
    1/4 ts Paprika
      4    Chicken breast halves
           Washed/patted dry
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl, combine
  canola oil, honey, lime juice and paprika. Place
  chicken, skin side up, in a 7x11 inch baking dish.
  Apply mixture to chicken pieces in a single layer.
  
  Bake in over for 35-40 minutes, basting every 8-10
  minutes or until well browned and juices run clear
  when you cut into the thickest part of chicken. Remove
  from oven. Cover with foil for 15 minutes. This
  softens chicken and keeps it hot until served. Serves
  4.
