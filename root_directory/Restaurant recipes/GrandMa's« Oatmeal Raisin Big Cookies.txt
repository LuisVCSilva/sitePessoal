GrandMa's® Oatmeal Raisin Big Cookies

GrandMa's Cookie Company was founded back in 1914 by Foster
 Wheeler, but it wasn't until 1977 that the company introduced
 the popular Big Cookie. This large, soft cookie comes two to
 a pack and is offered in several varieties, including oatmeal
 raisin. Now you can bake up a couple batches all your own with
 this spiffy kitchen clone. Just be sure not to overdo it in the
 oven. You want these cookies soft and chewy when cool - just
 like a happy grandma would make 'em -- so take them out when
 they are just beginning to turn light brown around the edges. 

1/2 cup raisins
1/3 cup water
1/2 cup vegetable shortening 
1 egg
1 1/2 cups dark brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups oats (not instant)
2 teaspoons baking soda 
3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup raisins

1. Preheat oven to 275 degrees.
2. Combine 1/2 cup raisins with water in a food processor and 
blend on high speed for about 1 minute or until very smooth.
3. Combine this raisin puree with the vegetable shortening, egg,
 brown sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl. Mix well with electric
 mixer until smooth.
4.  In a separate bowl, combine the flour with the oats, baking
 soda, cinnamon, and salt. Pour this dry mixture into the wet 
mixture and mix well until ingredients are incorporated. Mix in
 1/2 cup raisins.
5. Roll 3 tablespoon-size portions of the dough into a ball in 
your hands and press to 1/2-inch flat on an ungreased baking sheet.
 Bake for 18 to 20 minutes. Be careful not to overcook, or the
 cookies will not be chewy. Store in a sealed container.
Makes 16 to 18 cookies.
