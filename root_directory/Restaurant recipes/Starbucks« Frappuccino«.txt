Starbucks® Frappuccino®

Here's one that I get requests for all of the time,
 and that you won't yet find in any book. This is a
 clone for Starbuck's "Lowfat Creamy Blend of Coffee
 & Milk" that you can now find in the all-too-puny
 9 1/2-ounce bottles in most stores. Those little 
bottles will set you back at least a buck, but this 
Top Secret Recipes version costs a mere fraction of that.
 Plus, the recipe actually makes enough that you can get
 a pretty major caffeine buzz. Then, when you get down to
 the "Tidbits" I'll tell you how to clone espresso with a
 standard drip machine and ground coffee. Cool!

1/2 cup fresh espresso
2 1/2 cups lowfat milk (2 percent)
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon dry pectin*

Combine all of the ingredients in a pitcher or covered container.
 Stir or shake until sugar is dissolved. Chill and serve cold.
Makes 24 ounces. 

Tidbits

To make the "Mocha" variety:
Add a pinch (1/16 teaspoon) of cocoa powder to the mixture before
 combining.

To fake espresso with a drip coffee maker and standard grind of
 coffee:
Use 1/3 cup ground coffee and 1 cup of water.
Brew once then run coffee through machine again, same grounds.
Makes about 1/2 cup fresh espresso to use in the above recipe.
Run a pot of water through machine, without grounds, to clean.

*This is a natural thickener found in fruits that is used for
 canning. You can find it in the supermarket near the canning
 supplies. It is used in this recipe to make the drink thicker
 and creamier, and can be found in the original recipe. It does
 not add to the flavor and can be excluded if you don't care so
 much about duplicating the texture of the real thing.
