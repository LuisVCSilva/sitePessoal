Schilling® Salad Supreme® Seasoning 

This orange-colored spice blend has been perking up salads,
 pasta, potatoes, hamburgers, and vegetables for years now,
 but I've never seen a homegrown clone for the stuff. Time
 to change that. While it's obvious that sesame seeds are a
 major part of this blend, you may not know that the main 
ingredient is Romano cheese (in the bottle, it's been dyed
 orange by the paprika). Be sure to store this one in the 
refrigerator. You might even want to keep the seasoning in
 an empty shaker-top spice bottle. And if you're in the mood
 for some tasty pasta salad, just check out the tidbit below 
that comes right off the bottle of the original product.

2 tablespoons Romano cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons sesame seeds
1 teaspoon paprika
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon poppy seeds
1/2 teaspoon celery seeds
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
dash cayenne pepper

1. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix well.
2. Pour blend into a sealed container (such as an empty spice bottle)
 and store chilled.
Makes 1/4 cup.
