Progresso® Italian-Style Bread Crumbs

Here's a real easy one that clones the most popular brand
 of seasoned bread crumbs. Just throw all of the ingredients
 into a small bowl, mix it up, and you're done. Use the 
finished product for an Italian-style breading - when frying
 or baking chicken, fish, pork chops, eggplant, etc. - just 
as you would the store-bought stuff.

1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon parsley flakes
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon sugar
dash oregano
