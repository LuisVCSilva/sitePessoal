  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      ounces        Bacon grease
     1/4  pound         Red onion -- dice fine
   2      cups          Water
     1/2  cup           Honey
     1/2  cup           Red wine vinegar
   2      tablespoons   Dijon mustard
   1 1/2  tablespoons   Cornstarch
   1      tablespoon    Tabasco

Place the bacon grease in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the
onions  and saute until the onions start to blacken. While the onions
are  carmelizing, in a mixing bowl place the water, honey and red wine
vinegar.  Using a wire whisk, mix the ingredients well. Add the
cornstarch and whisk well. After the onions have carmelized, add  the
Dijon mustard to the onions and stir together with a rubber spatula.
Add the water, vinegar, pepper (sic.) honey and cornstarch to the
mustard  and onions and mix. Continue stirring until mix thickens and
comes to a  boil. Remove from heat and store in refigerator until
needed. Note: To  reheat use a double boiler. I put the tabasco on the
ingredient list if  you like it. In differnt parts of the country
Bennigan's omits this  ingredient.
