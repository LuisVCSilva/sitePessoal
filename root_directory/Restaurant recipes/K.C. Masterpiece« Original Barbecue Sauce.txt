K.C. Masterpiece® Original Barbecue Sauce

Even though it's now owned and produced by the Clorox Company,
 the taste of Original K. C. Masterpiece barbecue sauce is the
 same as when it was first created in good ole' Kansas City,
 USA. This is the sauce that steals awards from all the other
 popular slathers on the market. It's now even is sold in a 
variety of flavors. But this is the clone for the original, 
and you'll find it very easy to make. Just throw all of the 
ingredients in a saucepan, crank it up to a boil, then simmer
for about an hour. Done deal. And just like the original
 Masterpiece, this stuff will make a work of art out of any
 of your grilled meats, or burgers and sandwiches; and as a
 dipping sauce or marinade.

 and whisk until smooth.
2. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 45

 overnight so that flavors can develop.

Tidbits
Liquid smoke is a flavoring found near the barbecue sauces and
 marinades.  Use hickory-flavored liquid smoke if you have a choice.
