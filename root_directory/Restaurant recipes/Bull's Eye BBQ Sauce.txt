Bull's Eye BBQ Sauce

1/2 C. chopped onions
1 (8 oz.) can tomatoes sauce
1 C. water (OPTION: Beer)
1 1/4 C. ketchup
2 T. brown sugar
2 T. prepared yellow mustard
1 T. olive oil
1 T. Worcestershire sauce
1 dash Tabasco sauce

Combine ingredients, cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
 I cooked this for 45 minutes to an hour. The sauce reduced
 itself and tasted good. If you taste the sauce before simmering,
 it will not taste as good as when the flavors have melded,
 but after cooking it is great.

Just like the 'real' sauce on barbecued pork steaks.  For
 the original, do not use beer.
