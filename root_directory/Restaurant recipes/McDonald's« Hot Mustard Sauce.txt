McDonald's® Hot Mustard Sauce

I finally got on the case to bring you the definitive kitchen
 clone for this one - and it's a cinch!  Tie one hand behind
 your back and witness plain old ground dried mustard mixing 
it up with sweet and sour flavors in a saucepan over medium heat.
  The cornstarch wrangles around in there to thicken and stabilize
 while Captain Habanero pops in for the perfect spicy punch.
  Use it for dipping, use it for spreading, use it again and again,
 since you'll make about a cup of the stuff.  And McDonald's will
 be glad that we no longer need to hoard the little blister packs 
from the restaurants.

1/2 cup water
1/2 cup corn syrup
1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon white vinegar
2 tablespoons ground dried mustard 
4 teaspoons cornstarch 
1 tablespoon granulated sugar 
1 tablespoon vegetable oil 
1/2 teaspoon turmeric 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
10-14 drops habanero hot sauce  

1. Combine all ingredients in a small uncovered saucepan. Whisk
 until smooth.
2. Turn heat to medium and bring mixture to a boil, stirring often.
 Sauce should thicken in 2 to 3 minutes after it begins to boil. 
Remove sauce from heat and chill in refrigerator in a covered 
container.
Makes 1 cup.
