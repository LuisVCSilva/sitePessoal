Mr & Mrs T® Rich & Spicy Bloody Mary Mix

Here's a way to clone the famous and very popular Bloody Mary
 Mix from that couple with only a letter as a last name. It's
 a simple-to-make blend of tomato juice and spices with some 
prepared horseradish and canned jalapeno juice thrown in for 
a "spicier, zestier" drink. Mix this with vodka over ice and 
you've got a delicious cocktail. But if you're not in the mood
 to get zoinked, this clone recipe is also a great way to kick 
up your tomato juice, just for drinking straight.

4 tablespoons lime juice
3 tablespoons juice from canned jalapenos (nacho slices)
3 tablespoons vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
dash garlic

 3 parts Mr & Mrs T Rich & Spicy Bloody Mary Mix to 1 part vodka,
 gin, rum or tequila, over ice. Mr & Mrs T Rich & Spicy Bloody 
Mary Mix is also delicious by itself. Simply pour over ice and 
serve."
