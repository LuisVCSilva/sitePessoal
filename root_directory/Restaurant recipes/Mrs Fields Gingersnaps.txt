      Yield: 30 servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Soda
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 ts Ginger
      1 ts Crystallized ginger; diced
    1/2 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Black pepper
  1 1/4 c  Dark brown sugar; packed
    3/4 c  Butter; softened
      1 lg Egg
    1/4 c  Unsulfured molasses
 
     Preheat oven to 300d F.  In a medium bowl combine flour, soda, salt,
  ginger, crystallized ginger, allspice and pepper. Mix well and set aside.
  In a large bowl, mix sugar and butter with an electric mixer set at medium
  speed. Scrape down sides of the bowl. Add egg and molasses, beat at medium
  speed until light and fluffy. Add the flour mixture and mix at low speed
  just until combined.  Chill the dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour--the
  dough well be less sticky and easier to handle. Form dough into balls 1
  inch in diameter. Place onto ungreased cookie sheets, 1 1/2 inches apart.
  Bake 24-25 minutes.  Use a spatula to immediately transfer cookies to a
  cool, flat surface.
