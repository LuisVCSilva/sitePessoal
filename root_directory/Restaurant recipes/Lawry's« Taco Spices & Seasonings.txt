Lawry's® Taco Spices & Seasonings

This is a clone for the stuff you buy in 1- ounce packets to
 create, as the package says, "a fun-filled Mexican fiesta in
 minutes." Isn't that so true? In fact, thanks to Lawry's my
 last Mexican fiesta was filled with so much fun that I had to
 take a siesta the next day. I owe it all to that fabulous little
 packet of seasoning. And now I promise you just as much fun with
 this TSR clone.  Golly, maybe even a tad more fun if you're lucky.
 Just mix the ingredients together in a small bowl, then add it to
 1 pound of browned ground beef along with some water and let it 
simmer. Before you know it you'll be up to your nostrils in good 
old-fashioned, taco-making fun. Better rest up, gosh darn it.

1 tablespoon flour
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon paprika
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon minced onion
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground oregano

1. Combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl.
2. To prepare the meat filling for the tacos as described on the 
original package instructions:
"In large skillet, brown 1 pound ground beef until crumbly; drain
 fat.  Add spices & seasoning and 2/3 cup water; mix thoroughly.
  Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, and cook, uncovered,
 7 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Spoon meat filling into
 warmed taco shells or tortillas. Top with shredded lettuce, 
grated cheddar cheese and chopped tomato. Use fresh salsa and 
guacamole if desired." 
Makes meat filling for 12 tacos (about 3 tablespoons each).
