Seven Seas® Free Viva Italian Fat-Free Dressing

Seven Seas dressings were first introduced by Anderson
 Clayton Foods back in 1964, when the trend toward fat-free
 foods was in its infancy. Kraft Foods later picked up the
 brand, and Seven Seas today ranks number four in sales of
 salad dressings in the United States. Here's our special
 technique to creating a delicious clone of Seven Seas
 spice-filled fat-free Italian dressing straight out of
 the latest TSR low-fat cookbook, using a secret combination
 of water, cornstarch and gelatin where the fat used to be.   
1 1/3 cups water 
1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar 
2 teaspoons cornstarch 
1 teaspoon salt 
1/2 teaspoon dried minced onion
1/2 teaspoon dried minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon finely minced red bell pepper
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon gelatin
1/2 cup white vinegar 
1 teaspoon dry nonfat buttermilk
1. Combine water, sugar, cornstarch, salt, onion, garlic,
 bell pepper, Italian seasoning, and gelatin in a small 
saucepan. Whisk to dissolve cornstarch, then set pan over
 medium/low heat. 
2. Heat mixture until boiling, stirring often. When mixture
 begins to boil, cook for 1 additional minute, stirring 
constantly, then remove from heat. 
3. Add vinegar and dry buttermilk to saucepan and stir. 
Transfer dressing to a covered container and refrigerate--
preferably overnight--before serving.
Makes 1 1/2 cups.
