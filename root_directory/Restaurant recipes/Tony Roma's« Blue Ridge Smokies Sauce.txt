Tony Roma's® Blue Ridge Smokies Sauce

Of the four famous barbecue sauces served on those delicious,
 tender ribs at Tony Roma's, this is the only one that wasn't
 cloned in the third book, Top Secret Restaurant Recipes. This
 sweet, smoky sauce is great on pork spareribs cooked with the
 technique found on page 298 of the book, or you can use it on 
a recipe of your own that includes pork or beef ribs, even chicken.
 Now Tony Roma's sells each of its four barbecue sauces at the
 restaurant chain, separately, or in gift sets of four. But if 
you don't have a Tony Roma's near you, this is the only way to
 get that one-of-a-kind barbecue taste at home.

1 cup ketchup
1 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup molasses
1 1/2 teaspoons liquid smoke
1/2 teaspoon salt
rounded 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder

1. Combine all of the ingredients in a medium saucepan over high
 heat, and whisk until smooth.
2. Bring sauce to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered 
for 30-40 minutes or until sauce has thickened. Use on pork 
spareribs -- as cooked with the method from the book Top Secret
 Restaurant Recipes -- or any of your beef, pork or chicken recipes.
Makes 1 1/2 cups.
