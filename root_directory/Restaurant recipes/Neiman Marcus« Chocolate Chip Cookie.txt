Neiman Marcus® Chocolate Chip Cookie

To dispel the urban legend of the $250 recipe, as told in the
 text of the infamous chain letter recipe, Neiman Marcus created
 an actual recipe for chocolate chip cookies and displayed it on
 the Neiman Marcus Web site...for a limited time only. I recently 
went to take another look at the recipe, and it was gone. Georgia 
Christiansen, Neiman Marcus Creative Director, told me that the 
recipe will no longer be featured on the site. But she did send 
me a copy. Since I get so many request for the recipe, and because
 I get even more e-mail copies of the bogus chain letter, I will 
post the recipe here. Maybe this will help put an end to the myth.

1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups flour
1 1/2 teaspoons instant coffee, slightly crushed
8 oz. semisweet chocolate chips

1. Cream the butter with the sugars until fluffy.
2. Beat in the egg and the vanilla extract
3. Combine the dry ingredients and beat into the butter mixture.
4. Stir in the chocolate chips.
5. Drop by large spoonfuls onto a greased cookie sheet.
6. Bake at 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes, or 10-12 minutes for a 
crispier
cookie. Makes 15 large cookies.
