Kraft® Shake'n Bake® (Original)

Need a recipe that copies Shake'n Bake in a pinch?
 Or maybe you don't feel like going to the store for
 the real thing.  Here's the TSR solution for a quick
 clone that will give you the same texture and flavor of
 Kraft Shake'n Bake using very common ingredients. You may
 notice the color is a bit different in this clone when 
compared to the real thing. That's because this recipe doesn't
 include beet powder - a hard to find ingredient that lends a 
dark orange tint to the original. But after you sink your teeth
 into the chicken (baked the same way as described on the
 Shake'n Bake box) and you'll swear it's the same stuff.  When
 you're ready to get shaking and baking, use this breading on
 2 1/2 pounds of chicken pieces or on 2 pounds of boneless, 
skinless chicken breasts.

1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon corn flake crumbs
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt 
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon sugar
scant 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
scant 1/4 teaspoon onion powder

1. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and stir to combine.
2. Prepare chicken following the same technique as described on
 the box of the original mix using 2 1/2 lbs. of bone-in chicken
 (6 to 8 pieces, with or without skin) or 2 lbs. boneless skinless
 chicken breast halves. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees, then moisten
 the chicken with water. Use a large plastic bag for the coating
 and use the same steps as described on the original package: 

"Shake moistened chicken, 1 to 2 pieces at a time, in shaker bag
 with coating mixture. Discard any remaining mixture and bag. Bake
 at 400 degrees in ungreased or foil-lined 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking
 pan until cooked through -
BONE-IN: 45 minutes/BONELESS: 20 minutes."
