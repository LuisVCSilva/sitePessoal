Outback Steakhouse® The Wallaby Darned 

The menu describes the steakhouse chain's popular fruity drink 
as a: "Down under frozen wonder with peaches, DeKuyper Peachtree
 Schnapps, champagne, Smirnoff Vodka and secret mixers." While you
 don't need to use the same brand-name booze as the chain does,
 you will need to find a can of Kern's peach nectar to re-create
 the same secret mixer magic.

1 cup frozen sliced peaches
2 ounces champagne
1 ounce peach schnapps
1 ounce vodka
4 ounces (1/2 cup) Kern's peach nectar
2 or 3 ice cubes

1. Combine all of the ingredients in a blender. Blend on high
 speed for approximately 30 seconds or until ice is completely 
crushed and the drink is smooth.
2. Pour into a 12-ounce glass and serve with a straw.
Makes 1 drink.
