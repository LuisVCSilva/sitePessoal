McDonald's® Breakfast Burrito®

It was in the late seventies, shortly after McDonald's had
 introduced the Egg McMuffin, that the food giant realized the
 potential of a quick, drive-thru breakfast. Soon, the company
 had developed several breakfast selections, including the Big
 Breakfast with eggs, hash browns, and sausage. Eventually one
 out of every four breakfasts eaten on the go would be served
 at McDonald's - an impressive statistic indeed. The newest 
kid on the McBreakfast block is this morning meal in a tortilla,
 first offered on the menu in 1991. 

4 ounces breakfast sausage
1 tablespoon minced white onion
1/2 tablespoon minced mild green chilies (canned)
4 eggs, beaten
salt
pepper
4 8-inch flour tortillas
4 slices American cheese

On the side
salsa

1. Preheat a skillet over medium heat. Crumble the sausage
 into the pan, then add the onion. Sauté the sausage and onion
 for 3 to 4 minutes or until the sausage is browned.
2. Add the mild green chilies and continue to sauté for 1 minute.
3. Pour the beaten eggs into the pan and scramble the eggs with 
the sausage and vegetables. Add a dash of salt and pepper.
4. Heat up the tortillas by steaming them in the microwave in 
moist paper towels or a tortilla steamer for 20 to 30 seconds.
5. Break each slice of cheese in half and position two halves 
end-to-end in the middle of each tortilla.
6. To make the burrito, spoon 1/4 of the egg filling onto the 
cheese in a tortilla. Fold one side of the tortilla over the 
filling, then fold up about two inches of one end. Fold over the 
other side of the tortilla to complete the burrito (one end should
 remain open). Serve hot with salsa on the side, if desired.
Makes 4 burritos.
