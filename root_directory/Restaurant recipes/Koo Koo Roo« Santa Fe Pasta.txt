1 16-ounce package Rotini pasta
4-5 quarts water

Dressing
1 1/4 cups V-8 juice
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
3/4 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup cooked yellow corn kernels
1/3 cup chopped cilantro
1/4 cup chopped green onion 
2 tablespoons diced red bell pepper
2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper

1 chicken breast fillet, cooked and diced

1. Prepare the pasta by bringing 4-5 quarts of water to a rolling
 boil in a large saucepan. Add pasta to the pan, and when water 
begins to boil again, cook for 8-11 minutes. Pasta should be al dente,
 or mostly tender but with a slight toughness in the middle. 
2. Whisk all of the dressing ingredients together in a small bowl.
 Cover and chill the dressing until you're ready to use it.
3. When pasta is done, pour it into a large bowl. Add the dressing,
 then toss.
4. Add the remaining ingredients to the pasta, and toss until combined.
 Cover and chill for several hours before serving.
Serves 8.
