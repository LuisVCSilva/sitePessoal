KFC® Macaroni & Cheese

Here's a clone for another of KFC's famous side dishes.
 We'll use easy-to-melt Velveeta, with its very smooth 
texture, as the main ingredient for the cheese sauce.
 Then a bit of cheddar cheese is added to give the sauce
 a sharp cheddary zing like the original. It's a very simple
 recipe that will take only 15 minutes to prepare. That's 
great news if you're a lazy cook like me who wants to dig right
 into the tasty vittles.  Weeell doggies!

6 cups water
1 1/3 cups elbow macaroni
4 ounces Velveeta cheese
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons whole milk
1/4 teaspoon salt

1. Bring water to a boil over high heat in a medium saucepan.
 Add elbow macaroni to the water and cook it for 10 to 12 minutes
 or until tender, stirring occasionally.
2. While the macaroni is boiling, prepare the cheese sauce by
 combining the remaining ingredients in a small saucepan over 
low heat. Stir often as the cheese melts into a smooth consistency.

3. When the macaroni is done, strain it and then pour it back into
 the same pan, without the water.
4. Add the cheese sauce to the pan and stir gently until the 
macaroni is well coated with the cheese. Serve immediately while hot.
Makes about 3 servings.
