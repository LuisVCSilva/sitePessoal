Red Robin® Seasoning

Give yourself some time to make a tough decision
because there are nearly two dozen gourmet burgers
on the Red Robin menu to pick from, not to mention
scores of other fantastic food choices. Red Robin 
claims its steak fries are world-famous, and when 
you get a burger your fries are served up on the 
side in a "bottomless" portion. Want some more fries?
Just ask and you can have as many as your belly can
pack in. But we found out that the burgers and fries
have a very special secret ingredient in common that
makes them taste so good: It's the Red Robin seasoning
that's sprinkled on the food. Next time you make a burger,
sprinkle some our version of the seasoning blend over the
patty. Cook up some frozen steak fries or french fries and
sprinkle a little of this blend over the top. You'll all
sorts of uses for this versatile spice. And the recipe 
makes a portion that should fit nicely in an empty spice bottle.
