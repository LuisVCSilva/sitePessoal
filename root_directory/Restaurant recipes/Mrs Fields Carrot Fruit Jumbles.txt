    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
      2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Quick oats (not instant)

    Preheat oven to 350*f. In a medium bowl combine flour, soda, baking
  powder, cloves, cinnamon, salt and oats. Mix well with a wire whisk and set
  aside. In a large bowl with an electric mixer, blend sugars. Add butter and
  mix to form a grainy paste. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add eggs and vanilla
  and beat at medium speed until light and fluffy.. Add carrots, pineapple
  and nuts, and blend until combined. Batter will appear lumpy. Add flour
  mixture and blend at low speed until just combined. Drop by rounded
  teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets, 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake 13-15
  minutes, taking care not to brown cookies. Immediately transfer cookies
  with a spatula to a cool, flat surface.
