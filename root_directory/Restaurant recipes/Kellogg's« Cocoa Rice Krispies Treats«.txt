Kellogg's® Cocoa Rice Krispies Treats®

It's the Rice Krispies Treat for all you chocolate lovers.
 By simply replacing regular Rice Krispies with Kellogg's
 Cocoa Krispies, then adding a bit of cocoa to the recipe, 
we can clone the exact flavor of the product you otherwise
 have to buy in boxes in the grocery store. This recipe makes
 16 of the crunchy brown bars, or the equivalent of two boxes
 of the real thing.

3 tablespoons margarine
1/4 teaspoon salt
5 cups miniature marshmallows
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
4 teaspoons cocoa
6 cups Cocoa Krispies cereal
non-stick cooking spray

1. Combine margarine and salt in a large saucepan over low heat.

2. When margarine has melted, add marshmallows and vanilla and stir
 until marshmallows have melted. Add cocoa and stir well. Remove 
from heat.
3. Add Cocoa Krispies and stir until the cereal is well coated with
 the melted marshmallow mixture.
4. Spray a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with a light coating of non-stick
 cooking spray. Pour the mixture into the dish and, using wax paper
 or lightly greased hands, press down until it's flat in the dish.
 Cool. Slice into 16 bars.
Makes 16 bars.
