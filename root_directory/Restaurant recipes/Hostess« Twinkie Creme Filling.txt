Hostess® Twinkie Creme Filling

Recently I've had an opportunity to go back and improve
 the recipe for the Hostess Twinkie clone found on page
 47 of the first book, "Top Secret Recipes." Specifically,
 I wanted to make the creme filling more stable, using 
non-dairy ingredients, so that it could not spoil and would
 be easier to make. Here now, is the much improved recipe,
 using fewer ingredients than the original clone, and with 
marshmallow creme as the new secret component. This recipe 
is for all of you who have supported the site by buying the 
books, since the cake part of the recipe and mold-making 
technique is not included here. But even if you don't have
 the books, I'm sure you can find many uses for this versatile,
 commercial-style, creme filling. Hope you like it!

2 teaspoons very hot water
rounded 1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups marshmallow creme (1 7-ounce jar)
1/2 cup shortening
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

1. Combine the salt with the hot water in a small bowl and stir
 until salt is dissolved. Let this mixture cool.
2. Combine the marshmallow creme, shortening, powdered sugar, 
and vanilla in a medium bowl and mix well with an electric mixer
 on high speed until fluffy.
3. Add the salt solution to the filling mixture and combine. 
Makes 1 1/2 cups.
