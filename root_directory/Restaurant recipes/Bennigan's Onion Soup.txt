     1/2  pound         Firm white onions -- sliced
     1/4  cup           Butter
   2      tablespoons   Corn oil
   3      tablespoons   Flour
   1      quart         Chicken broth
   1      quart         Beef broth
   8      slices        French bread
                        Swiss cheese -- shredded
                        Parmesan -- grated

Saute onions in butter and oil until onions are transparent, but not
well  browned. When tender, turn heat to lowest point and sprinkle with
flour,  stirring vigorously. Pour into Dutch oven and stir in broths.
Heat thoroughly and divide among 8 oven-proof bowls. Float a slice of
bread atop each serving. Mix equal parts of cheese to  smooth paste and
spread over bread. Place all bowls on oven rack 4" from broiler heat and
broil until cheese  melts. Serve at once. Leftover soup freezes well up
to 6 months.
