Kenny Rogers Roasters® Corn Muffins

He knows when to hold em, and he knows when to fold em. And 
lately he's been folding em quite a bit as Kenny Rogers Roasters
 restaurants across the country have bolted their doors for lack
 of interest.  Looks like that whole "home meal replacement" 
think hasn't worked out too well for this fire-roasted chicken
 chain.  But that doesn't mean that Kenny didn't know how to make
 awesome corn muffins that are served with every meal.  And since
 it's becoming harder and harder to find a Kenny Rogers Roasters
 outlet, we have no choice but to duplicate these at home if we 
want to re-create this part of the Kenny experience.
