Jacquin's® Peppermint Schnapps Liqueur 

Here's a liqueur that's simple to make at home. All you need
 is an inexpensive vodka and an empty bottle to store the 
Schnapps in. This is another recipe that was created for More
Top Secret Recipes, but just didn't make it into the final 
version. Try storing it in the freezer for a cold shot on a 
hot summer day. Whoof! 

1/3 cup granulated sugar
1 16-oz. bottle light corn syrup
2 cups 80-proof vodka
2 teaspoons peppermint extract 

1. Combine sugar and corn syrup in a 2 quart pan over medium
 heat. Heat until sugar dissolves, stirring regularly 
(about 5 minutes).
2. When sugar has dissolved, add vodka and stir well. Remove
 mixture from heat and cover tighly with lid. Let cool.
3. Add peppermint extract to mixture and pour into a sealable
 bottle.
Makes 4 cups.
