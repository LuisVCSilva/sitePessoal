Sonic® Cherry Limeade 

Here's the signature drink from the chain that's reviving
 the drive-up burger joint, just like a scene out of American
 Graffiti or Happy Days. It was in 1953 that Troy Smith obtained
 the parcel of land in Shawnee, Oklahoma that was big enough
 to fit the new steakhouse and root beer stand that was his 
dream. Troy thought he'd make he steakhouse his primary operation,
 but as it turned out folks preferred the hot dogs and cold drinks
 over at the root beer stand. So Troy did the smart thing and 
ditched the steakhouse to focus all his efforts on the other joint.
 At first he called the root beer stand "Top Hat," but when Troy
 found out later that name was already being used, he came up 
"Sonic" to signify "service at the speed of sound." Today the 
chain is the sixth largest hamburger outlet in the country. 
This recipe makes a simple, old-fashioned drink by combining 
Sprite with cherry juice and some lime wedges. Use cherry juice
 made by Libby under the brand-name Juicy Juice for the best home
 clone.

12 ounces Sprite (1 can)
3 lime wedges (1/8 of a lime each)
1/4 cup cherry juice (Libby's Juicy Juice is best)

1. Fill a 16-ounce glass 2/3 full with ice.
2. Pour Sprite over the ice.
3. Add the juice of three lime wedges and drop them into the drink. 
4. Add the cherry juice and serve with a straw.
Makes 1 16-ounce drink (medium size).
