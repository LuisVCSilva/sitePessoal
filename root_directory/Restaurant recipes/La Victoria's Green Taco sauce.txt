--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      lbs.          Anaheim or New Mex. chiles -- Roast -- peel, deseed
   1      lb.           Yellow Hungarian Wax chiles -- seeded and chopped
   1                    Serranos and jalapeno -- seeded and chopped
   2 1/2  lbs.          Tomatillos -- slice 1/8" thick
   7      lbs.          Green tomatoes -- slice 1/4" thick
     1/2  bunch         Cilantro -- rough chop
   4      cloves        Garlic
   1      med.          White onion -- chopped
     1/4  cup           Lime juice
     1/4  cup           Apple cider vinegar
   2      Tbs.          Salt
   4      Tbs.          Corn Starch

Heat a large cast iron skillet to hot and toast the tomatoes and  tomatillos
without any oil.  Do just one layer at a time and give each  slice a nice
dark brown color on both sides without burning.  Remove  when toasted to a
glass bowl.  Do not deglaze the pan.
In a blender, combine the onion, cilantro, chiles, tomatoes, garlic and
tomatillos in batch sizes to half-fill the blender jar.  Pur|e.  If any
dark brown liquid collects in the bottom of the toasted tomato and
tomatillo bowl, add this to the last blender load.
Mix the cornstarch in the lime juice/vinegar.  In a large stewing pot,
combine the blender loads, add the cornstarch mixture and heat until  the
sauce comes to a low boil, mixing constantly.  Be careful here, if  you
don't mix constantly the thick sauce will tend to erupt in hot  little
geysers of taco sauce that could burn you.  Allow sauce to cool  and add
salt to taste.  Transfer to clean jars, filling them 3/4 full  and freeze
what you can't use in a few weeks.  Be careful not to fill  the jars too
full or they'll break when you freeze them.
I made a batch of sauce last year and it tastes just fine after a year  in
the freezer.  The sauce keeps OK in my refrigerator for at least a  month.
* Adjust heat level to your personal taste.  The La Victoria sauce is  mild.
3 to 4 quarts
