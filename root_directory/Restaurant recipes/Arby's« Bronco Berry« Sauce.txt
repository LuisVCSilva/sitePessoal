Arby's® Bronco Berry® Sauce

This sweet and spicy jelly sauce comes on the side,
in little 1.5-ounce containers, with Arby's battered
jalapeno and cheese Side Kickers. But, you know, you
ust never get enough of the tasty gelatinous goo in
those little dipping packs to use later with your own
home-cooked delicacies.  And isn't it odd that the sauce
is called "Bronco Berry" when there's not a berry to be
found in there?  Sure, the sauce is bright red and sugary,
but you won't find a speck of fruit on the ingredients list. 
Nevertheless, the sweet and spicy flavors make this a 
delicious jelly sauce that has many uses beyond dipping
quick service finger foods.  For one, use it as a side
for your next batch of lamb chops rather than mint jelly. 
It would take more than just a few blister packs to perk
u that meal.
