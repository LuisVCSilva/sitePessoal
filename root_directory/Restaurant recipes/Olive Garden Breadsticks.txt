Olive Garden Breadsticks

1 Loaf unfrozen bread dough - (if frozen, thaw in bowl at room temp)
Pam or oil
Garlic powder
Dry oregano leaf -- rub between fingers

When dough is soft enough to knead, spray your fingers with Pam 
or oil and knead just until you can shape into cigar-sized pieces 
(about 8 to 10). Place these 3" apart on Pam-sprayed cookie sheets.
 Let rise in warm place until doubled - about 1-1/2 hours. Then
 holding Pam about 8" from sticks, lightly spray top of each and 
then dust with garlic powder and oregano. Bake at 375~ about 20 to
 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool in pan on rack to serve 
within a day or two.

Olive Garden Breadsticks are just brown and serve soft breadsticks.
 Brown in the oven and spread liquid margarine over them, then 
sprinkle with garlic salt.
