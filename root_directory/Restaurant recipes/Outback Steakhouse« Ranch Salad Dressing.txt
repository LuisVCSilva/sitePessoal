Outback Steakhouse® Ranch Salad Dressing 

This always-popular growing restaurant chain makes a tasty
 version of creamy ranch dressing for its house and Queensland
 salads. To get the same unique flavor and creaminess of the 
original at home, mates, you'll need just one teaspoon of Hidden
 Valley ranch salad dressing mix swimming in there with the mayo
 and buttermilk and other spices. Since there's three teaspoons 
of dressing mix per packet, you'll be able to stretch one envelope
 three times as far, by crackey!

1 cup mayonnaise 
1/2 cup buttermilk 
1/4 teaspoon coarse grind black pepper 
1/8 teaspoon paprika 
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder    =   

1. Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl. Mix well.
