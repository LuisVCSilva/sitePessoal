Combine milk, Mayo, sugar and flour. Beat with mixer at high speed, not
quite 1 minute until smooth and completely combined. Remove beaters. Use
rubber spatula to streak the dough with 1/4c cheese food. Drop batter
equally between 10 paper-lined muffin wells. Drizzle top of  each with ts
liquid margarine and dust each with a little garlic powder  plus 1 scant ts
additional cheese food. Bake 350~ 25 to 30 minutes or  until golden brown
and tripled in size. Cool in pan on racks for 30  minutes. Add only enough
flour so batter drops from spoon.
