Hard Rock Cafe® Cole Slaw

If you want the authentic Hard Rock Cafe Pig Sandwich experience,
 you just have to serve your clone of that pulled-pork sandwich
 with this creamy, delicious cole slaw on the side. Even if you
 don't whip up the sandwich, you'll want to dive into a batch of
 this secret slaw. It's just too easy to make, and Who Wants to 
be a Millionaire? isn't on tonight. But be sure to let the stuff
 hibernate in the fridge for a day or two after you toss it. 
That's the only way to get the flavors up to dancing the perfect
 tastebud mambo. 

1 1/3 cups mayonnaise 
3 tablespoons white vinegar 
2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons granulated sugar 
2 tablespoons milk  
dash salt 
8 cups chopped cabbage (1 head)
1/2 cup shredded carrot 

1. Combine all ingredients except the cabbage and carrots in a
 large bowl and blend until smooth with an electric mixer.
2. Add cabbage and carrots and toss well.
3. Cover and chill overnight in the refrigerator. The flavors
 fully develop after 24 to 48 hours.
Serves 6 to 8 as a side dish.
