Good Seasons® Italian Salad Dressing Mix

Here's a clone for the instant dressing mix you buy in the
 little .7-ounce packets. When added to vinegar, water, and
 oil, you get one of the best-tasting instant salad dressings
 around. But what if you can't find the stuff, or it is no 
longer sold in your area, as I've heard from so many? Or maybe
 you want to save some money and make a bunch of your own?
 Just use the recipe below to make as much dry mix as you want,
 and save it for when you need instant salad satisfaction.
I've used McCormick lemon pepper in the recipe here because
 it contains lemon juice solids that help duplicate the taste
 of the sodium citrate and citric acid in the real thing. 
The dry pectin, which can be found near the canning supplies 
in your supermarket, is used as a thickener, much like the
xanthan gum in the original product. 

1 teaspoon carrot, grated and finely chopped
1 teaspoon red bell pepper, finely minced
3/4 teaspoon McCormick lemon pepper
1/8 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
2 teaspoons sugar
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
2 teaspoons dry pectin
pinch ground oregano


1. Place the carrot and bell pepper on a baking pan in an oven
 set on 250 degrees for 45 to 60 minutes, or until all of the 
small pieces are completely dry, but not browned.
2. Combine the dried carrot and bell pepper with the other 
ingredients in a small bowl. Mix can be stored in a sealed 
container indefinitely until needed.
3. When ready to use, pour 1/4 cup of vinegar into a cruet or
 jar. Add 3 tablespoons of water, then the dressing mix. Seal 
and shake vigorously. Add 1/2 cup of oil and shake until well 
blended.
Serves 8 to10.
