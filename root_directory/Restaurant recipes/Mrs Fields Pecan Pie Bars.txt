    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
      2 ts Pure vanilla extract
      3 lg Eggs; beaten
  1 1/2 c  Chopped pecans
 
      Preheat oven to 350-degrees F. In a medium bowl combine flour and
  chilled butter with a pastry cutter until dough resembles coarse meal. Add
  water gradually and mix just until dough holds together and can be shaped
  into a ball. Or, use a food processor fitted with metal blade to combine
  four and butter until they resemble coarse meal.  Add watter by
  tablespoonfuls and process just until a dough ball begins to form. Wrap
  dough tightly in a plastic scrap or a plastic bag. Refrigerate 1 hour or
  until firm.
      On floured board using a floured rolling pin, roll out dough into a
  10x10-inch pan.  Fold dough in half and then into quarters. Place it in an
  8x8-inch baking pan.  Unfold the dough and press it into the corners and up
  along the sides of the pan. Refrigerate 15 minutes.
  
     TO PREPARE THE FILLING: Melt 5 tablespoons of butter in medium saucepan
  over medium heat. Remove from heat, and stir in sugar and corn syrup. Mix
  until smooth. Add vanilla and eggs, and beat with spoon until thoroughly
  combined. Fold in chopped pecans. Pour the pecan filling into the
  pastry-lined pan. If dough extends beyond filling minsture trim dough with
  a knife. Place pan in center of oven and bake 50-60 minutes or until
  filling is set. Cool on wire rack. Cut into 2x2-inch square, and top each
  with a pecan half. Serve at room temperature or chilled.
