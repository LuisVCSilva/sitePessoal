Ingredients 
15 chocolate sandwich cookies
1/2 cup dry roasted peanuts
vegetable cooking spray
4 tablespoons butter or margarine
3 quarts chocolate ice cream
(7) 1.8 ounce packages milk chocolate covered peanut butter cups
(1) 8 ounce jar milk chocolate fudge topping
1/4 cup strong brewed coffee
2 tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur


Preparation 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a food processor or blender,

 Spray 9-inch pie plate with vegetable cooking spray. Reserve 1
 tablespoon cookie mixture for garnish. In pie plate, mix butter
 or margarine and remaining cookie mixture by hand. Press mixture
 onto bottom and up side of pie plate. Bake 8 minutes. Cool crust
 completely on wire rack.

Meanwhile, place chocolate ice cream in refrigerator about 40 
minutes to soften slightly. Coarsely chop milk chocolate covered
 peanut butter cups. In a large bowl mix softened ice cream with
 chopped peanut butter cups. Spoon ice cream mixture into cooled
 cookie crust. Sprinkle reserved crumb mixture on top. Freeze until
 firm, at least 6 hours or overnight.To serve, let pie stand at 
room temperature 15 minutes for easier slicing. Meanwhile, in a
 1-quart saucepan over low heat, heat milk chocolate fudge topping
 until hot; stir in coffee and liqueur until blended. Cut pie 
into wedges and serve with warm fudge sauce.
