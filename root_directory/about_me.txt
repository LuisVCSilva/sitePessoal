I'm 23 years old, and I love solving problems and programming my way into an efficient and elegant solution. I'm currently studying 
hybrid models for crowd simulation. My interests are focused in Computational Modelling.

A little bit about this website:
This website is a CLI application in which all commands inputed are sent to an Apache server using AJAX, 
every command that you call is actually a PHP script that runs in the server and return it's output as a JSON 
to the page, if the command you typed is not associated with any PHP script in the server, the command is interpreted as a 
Javascript statement, running on your side. 
Every PHP script will return a JSON, if this JSON has a key named 'eval', the code
will be automatically executed in your browser. 

I made my personal website like this because it's easier to use 
(no buttons or menus, you just type what you want), and I can easily program more
stuff here and care only to the 'logic' stuff, no interface design 
(I could do it if I wanted it, I just don't).
